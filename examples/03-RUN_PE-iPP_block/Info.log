        PCIF is an open-source python library to quickly  prepare the required
        files to prepare and perform CG simulations.
        Currently, only VOTCA is implemented.

		TRICK  : To get the coordinates for the CG map after run this program, you should.
		         executes the following command:
		         csg_map --top <TPR_FILE_FOR_AA_MODEL> --trj <TRJ_or_GRO_FILE_FOR_AA_MODEL> 
		                  --cg <XML_MAP_PRODUCED> --out <GRO_FILENAME_FOR_CG>
